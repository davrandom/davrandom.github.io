"MetaWatch":http://www.metawatch.org is an opensource operated watch. But as you might guess this is not only a "simple" watch: it's a MetaWatch. Ok... this was obvious from its name, but what does this mean? It means that the watch is a layer between you and your smartphone.

The Meta Watch platforms utilize embedded Bluetooth® technology to connect to smartphones, mobile devices and other Bluetooth enabled devices. The Meta Watch platform is based on the MSP430F5438A MSP430™ ultra-low-power microcontroller and CC2560 Bluetooth host controller solution from Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI).

Interesting! (for those who have a smartphone)
