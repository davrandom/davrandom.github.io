## Intro

Here I will publish my loudspeakers' designs with as much detail as possible. If you have questions or feel that some detail is missing, feel free to ask in the comments section below.

The name I chose for my loudspeakers, **/ear/nest**, should explain clearly what is the philosophy: they are **Earnest**, *honest*, I will publish as much details, measurements, ... as I can, and they are possibly *good*, an "**ear nest**".

## Zero model

Sorry for the terrible picture, I will take some better ones soon.

The idea here was to prove that, with the limited tools I have, I am able to cut the wood, glue the box, cut a hole, mill the borders, screw the transducer and paint the whole thing. Given the size of the box, the target was to create a couple of surrounds and a central loudspeaker for my home theater. The expectations weren't too high, but after trying them in our critical listening room we were surprised and pleased by the incredible detail of the stereo image. For this reason I gave them to a couple of friends and I hope they will write a small review and I will probably carry out some measurements.


### Hardware
* [Tymphany TC9FD18-08 3-1/2"](http://www.parts-express.com/tymphany-tc9fd18-08-3-1-2-full-range-paper-cone-woofer--264-1062) full range paper cone woofer (from Parts Express)
* 1 cm thick plywood (from local LeRoy Merlin)
* [Square speaker wire spring terminal cup](http://www.parts-express.com/parts-express-square-speaker-wire-spring-terminal-cup--260-297) (from Parts Express)

### Design
It is a simple 12 cm cube (outer dimensions). The transducer is mounted from the inside, because it's meant to be like that.
The design is quite common, for example see Auratone (bigger) or Grover Notting CR-1 (same transducer size, smaller box 11 cm).

### Specs
150 Hz - 16 kHz
