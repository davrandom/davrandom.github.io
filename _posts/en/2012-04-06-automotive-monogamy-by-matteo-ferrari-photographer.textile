...This time I confess, this link comes from "la Repubblica":http://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2012/04/04/foto/quattro_route_per_sempe-32758842/1/?ref=HRESS-7 ;) more or less quoting from there:
<txp:article_image />

p. "Matteo Ferrari":http://www.matteoferrari.net/ is a 44-years-old italian photographer born in Liguria and now living in Milan. His project collects photographic images of Italians who, decades later, still use their old car: the first car you never forget. "I've noticed this trend and I thought to make a service. Photographing owners with the old car was a way to tell their stories without adding anything else." Ferrari has worked on the project since 2001 and with growing enthusiasm, and then has replicated the idea in Argentina.

The two galleries are "here the italian version":http://www.matteoferrari.net/i/0201.htm and here for "Argentina.":http://www.matteoferrari.net/e/0218.htm
