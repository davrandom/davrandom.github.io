excerpt: An "hope I will be better" kind of post

After some time experimenting with 2.0 Octopress and trying (prematurely) to switch to 3.0 (failing), I decided to go back to good old jekyll.
It's simple. It works. End of the story.

Since the vast majority of my posts are just personal memos, I will use this to same some links on markdown (just not to goole *every* time I have to write a post).

So:

1. [Markdown basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) 
2. [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 
3. [Mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) 

HTH
