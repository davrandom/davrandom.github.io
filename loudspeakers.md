## Zero model

![model Zero (terrible mobile phone picture...)](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1588/25864464542_67f3732361.jpg)

Sorry for the terrible picture, I will take some better ones soon.

### Hardware
* Tymphany TC9FD18-08 3-1/2" full range paper cone woofer (from Parts Express)
* 1 cm thick plywood (from local LeRoy Merlin)
* Square speaker wire spring terminal cup (from Parts Express)

### Design
It is a simple 12 cm cube (outer dimensions). The transducer is mounted from the inside, because it's meant to be like that.
The design is quite common, for example see Auratone (bigger) or Grover Notting CR-1 (same transducer size, smaller box 11 cm).

### Specs
150 Hz - 16 kHz
