I was struggling searching for a software that made a collage from my pictures, mimicking a photo... and today I succeeded:

!{{ root_url }}/images/5t.jpg?1328191695!:{{ root_url }}/images/5.jpg

It's not really something to be proud but it's indeed a starting point.
The instructions are well described "here":http://linuxaria.com/article/photo-collage-mosaic-linux?lang=en .

*As an example:*
to prepare the pictures
<pre> $ metapixel-prepare -r sourcefolder destinationfolder --width=48 --height=48 </pre>
to create the mosaic
<pre> $ metapixel --metapixel input.jpg output.png -l destinationfolder -s 10 </pre>
there are many options you can add. Try typing _metapixel_ in your bash :)
