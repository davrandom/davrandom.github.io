picture by "Superben,":http://www.flickr.com/photos/superben155 thanks!

I'm *interested* in _open source, i.e. GNU/Linux, open hardware (openmoko, arduino, ...), open mapping (openstreetmap),  ... in music, acoustics, photography, motorbikes, traveling around, DIY, ..._

I have a "M.Sc.":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree in "particle physics":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics from "University of Trieste (Italy).":http://df.units.it/?q=en

Now I'm enrolled at "UPF":http://www.upf.edu/en/ for a "Ph.D.":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy in "Information and Communication Technologies.":http://www.upf.edu/dtic/en/ In the meantime I worked for a non-profit foundation called "Barcelona Media.":http://www.barcelonamedia.org/ Now I moved to a bigger company, still working on sound and maths.

* My Bachelor's thesis *`Una tecnica di calibrazione con elettroni isolati per il calorimetro elettromagnetico di CMS'* ("on INFN official website":http://www.infn.it/thesis/thesis_dettaglio.php?tid=2644) ("or download from here":http://scaini.org/site/file_download/12/tesi.pdf)

* *`Decoding of Higher Order Ambisonics to Irregular Periphonic Loudspeaker Arrays´*
_Authors_: Scaini, Davide; Areaga, Daniel. "Published":http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=17364 in 55th AES International Conference: Spatial Audio (Helsinki, August 2014)
* *`Measurements of jet multiplicity and differential production cross sections of Z+jets events in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV´*
_Authors_: CMS Collaboration. "Published":http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1408.3104 Submitted to Phys. Rev. D
* *`Layout Remapping Tool for Multichannel Audio Productions´* 
_Authors_: Schmele, Tim; García-Garzón, David; Sayin, Umut; Scaini, Davide; Arteaga, Daniel. "Published":http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=16807 in AES 134th Convention.


Public Code:
* ATM my public code is very limited (for several reasons). In "this repository":https://bitbucket.org/davrandom/misc_projects/src I collect some files that I find useful (configuration files or nano-projects).
This might not be useful for other people, but after few times I forgot/lost code around, I simply decided that it's better to publish it. 
* During my period in BM I devloped "IDHOA":https://github.com/BarcelonaMedia-Audio/idhoa which is a piece of code to generate Ambisonics decodings for periphonic or dome-like irregular layouts. We wrote a paper presented at 55th AES International Conference (August 2014). The code is GPL, so feel free to contribute.
_update_ I forked my own project since I left BM. The "updated code can be found here.":https://github.com/davrandom/idhoa We presented another paper on IDHOA at the 138th AES Convention (May 2015) *`An Evaluation of the IDHOA Ambisonics Decoder in Irregular Planar Layouts´*.

Presentations:
* TBD
