(preamble: I do many things over the web every day, search for solutions, find solutions, implement solutions... then I forget everything. So some posts like this are just a collection of things for future memory)

I am developing a website with Drupal and the client asked me if it is possible to embed a PDF viewer in a Drupal node (ok the question was not _that_ precise ...). I always answer "everything is possible... we have to understand if you need that!" ... but this is another story.

So my problem is almost the one described "here.":http://drupal.org/node/154009
There are several solutions (right now I have tried none of them), depending on the Drupal version you are using. For Drupal 7 there is a "straightforward solution,":http://drupal.org/project/pdf_reader while for Drupal 6 is not so easy... I will talk then about Drupal 6.

One possible solution is to use "SWF tools":http://drupal.org/project/swftools together with "FlexPaper.":http://flexpaper.devaldi.com/docs.htm The trick is to "convert" the pdf to a swf via FlexPaper and then use 'SWF tools' module to display the swf produced by FlexPaper. This is not really easy to implement inside Drupal ("see this comment":http://drupal.org/node/154009#comment-4356032 that redirects to this "issue for swf tools":http://drupal.org/node/759198).

Another possible solution is the "fileviewer module":http://drupal.org/project/fileviewer ... that later became the "PDF module":http://drupal.org/project/pdf_reader for Drupal 7. I really don't know if it works on Drupal 6... I will try the fileviewer module first, and then give a try to the fexpaper+swf tools.
