An EcoSphere is a sealed glass bowl with one or two shrimps living in it. Maybe you have seen this strange micro-world in some shop, but how does it work? After discussing with some friends I searched and found [this link](http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/ecosphere/) to the NASA website.

I hope it will give some insight ;)
