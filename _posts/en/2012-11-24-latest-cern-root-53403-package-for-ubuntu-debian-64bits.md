Latest Cern Root 5.34.03 package for Ubuntu/Debian 64bits is available for download in my [sourceforge project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cernrootdebs/) with a nice and very helpful page :) just [one click from here.](http://{{) root\_url }}/images/projects/27/root-packages-for-debian-and-ubuntu

Check it out! [(direct download)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cernrootdebs/files/latest/download)

ps: I compiled this package on Ubuntu 10.04, since Ubuntu 12.04 doesn’t allow anymore to put packages in /opt. Soon we will have to decide if:
- continue packaging in 10.04 with packages destistation /opt
- switch to 12.04 with destination /usr/local
Since I have both WM it’s just a matter of taste. Any hint is very welcome.
