bq. *Q: Will it blend?*
A: Yes, though this does void the warranty.

h2. Aaron Seigo "answers some questions":http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2012/02/spark-answers.html about "Spark":http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2012/01/reveal.html .

??*Q: When can I buy one?*??
??A: Pre-order registration will open early next week. This was one piece in the puzzle that was taking a bit longer than I had hoped for to come together, but it's finally slotted in and our distribution partner has got the necessary infrastructure settled. I'll lift the veil off of the pre-order and our distribution strategy when it goes live.??

??*Q: When will Spark start shipping?*??
??A: We expect to start shipping Sparks to you starting in May 2012. We have a lot of pieces to coordinate, and not just technical issues like the OS image and the content add-on store, but things like packaging design, manufacturing, shipping, import, retail channel coordination. So far we're on track, but I don't want to offer a more precise date than "May" until we pull the trigger on production.??

I consider it as an interesting device, especially because I would like to install something like Navit... but:

??*Q: Can I get one with built-in 3G and GPS?*??
??A: Not in the first run of devices. We do plan on providing Spark models with 3G (BYOS: Bring your own SIM. ;) and GPS later.??

...so I'll wait :D
