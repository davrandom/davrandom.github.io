Siccome sono iscritto alla mailing list di OpenMoko, faccio leggere a<br />tutti i traguardi raggiunti... vedremo presto come si riperquoteranno<br />in usabilità e funzionalità ;-)  (è un'alpha)<br />d<br /><br />Dear Community,<br />We are proud to announce the release of Om 2008.8 for public reviewing.<br />It represents our current state of development over the last 6 months.<br />We came a long way before achieving this milestone.<br />Here is what you can expect:<br />- A stable and working phone stack realized by using Qtopia.<br />- A new and flexible window manager [Illume] that broadens our support for the different graphic libraries, including GTK+ and more.<br />- The whole system software has been reworked which leads to a very fast and reliable suspend &amp; resume, LED control and power management.<br />- A graphical frontend [Installer] for package management as installing, removing or updating applications via repositories.<br />- Also included is an application which combines GPS and SMS [Locations] for easy sharing of locations among friends.<br />For detailed information about Om 2008.8 (including instructions, references and currently known issues) check out our wiki at: <a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Om_2008.8">http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Om_2008.8</a><br />Please consider this a next step towards an open end user ready mobile platform.
