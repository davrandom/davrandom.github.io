Deep beneath the farms of France, physics takes a massive chance.<br />Europe's best and brightest teams focus up their narrow beams,<br />While gangs of dedicated geeks tighten tubes and look for leaks.<br />Giant magnets, so it's said, accelerate a proton thread<br />Until it hits the speed of light—well, maybe not exactly quite—<br />But anyhow, extremely fast. The speed of light is unsurpassed.<br /><br />When protons have sufficient spin, they're whacked against their proton kin,<br />Spun from an opposing strand, swirled around from Switzerland,<br />All aligned with great precision, smashed together in collision.<br />Then, whatever fragments found, fathom matters most profound:<br />Like, What are mass and gravity, space and supersymmetry?<br />Dimensions deep and matter dark? What riddles lurk within the quark?<br />Is it worth the money spent on this vast experiment?<br />Other questions, not as thrilling, strangely garner equal billing:<br /><br />What if all this, just perhaps, precipitates a mass collapse?<br />Could the apparatus heave a flying hadron through Geneva?<br />Could quantum spin and somersaults zap the gold in Zurich's vaults?<br />Sour the milk and spook the pigs? Just what if the hunt for Higgs<br />Tolls our final self-destruction or invites an alien abduction?<br />What would Isaac Newton think? Would he envision Earth might sink?<br />Humanity, prosperity, down a singularity?<br /><br />For this we've waited many years to have a hadron smash,<br />Boldly probing new frontiers and spending piles of cash.<br />Scientists seem unconcerned, proudly listing all they've learned,<br />While their rivals gather traction in equal and opposing action.<br />Alas, no protons whizz around, and silent is the ring.<br />No hadrons thread the underground, at least until the spring.<br />Some free advice on this device, while disappointment lingers:<br />Find that glitch and throw the switch! Be sure and cross your fingers!<br /><b><br />Andrew Croal<br />Toronto, Canada</b><br /><br /><br />From: <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=PHTOAD000062000002000012000002&amp;idtype=cvips">http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=PHTOAD000062000002000012000002&amp;idtype=cvips</a><br /><b>Un genio veramente!</b><br /><br /><br />dimenticavo... da una segnalazione del nostro buon FlorianZ!
