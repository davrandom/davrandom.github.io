I'm writing some documentation in markdown these days, and I'm using vim. I don't know why but the syntax highlight in my vim is just plain wrong, and disturbing.

So I wanted to [switch off the syntax highlight](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/How_to_turn_off_all_colors), at least temporarily. Easy:

```
:syntax off
```

aaaah much better now.
HTH
