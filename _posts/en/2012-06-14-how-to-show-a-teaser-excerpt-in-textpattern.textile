My last post was a bit long, so I searched for a way of showing a teaser in textpattern.
While in Drupal generating a teaser is more or less easy (it's more difficult to remove it with its "read more" link... I will talk about this somewhere in the future), in textpattern the information is a bit fragmented and spread in forums, plugins collections ... but the easiest solution is always under your nose.

It's not as straightforward as you might desire, but it works!
