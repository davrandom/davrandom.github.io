While surfing around the web, I found this interesting "photgraphic project:":http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/sets/72157620856436476/ <txp:article_image />

"For the Documerica Project (1971-1977), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hired freelance photographers to capture images relating to environmental problems, EPA activities, and everyday life in the 1970s.

The U.S. National Archives digitized more than 15,000 photographs from the series Documerica (Local ID 412-DA) and included them in our online catalog."
