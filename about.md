![That's me!](/images/18t.jpg) <br>
picture by [Superben,](http://www.flickr.com/photos/superben155) thanks!

I'm Davide Scaini and I'm interested in **experimenting**. Working with sound is an happy accident that gives me satisfaction.

I'm interested in *open source, open hardware, open mapping (openstreetmap), music,
acoustics, photography, bicycles, motorbikes, traveling around, DIY, ...*

I have a [M.Sc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree) in
[particle physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics) from
[University of Trieste (Italy).](http://df.units.it/?q=en)

In 2019 I obtained a [Ph.D.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy) 
in [Information and Communication Technologies](http://www.upf.edu/dtic/en/) 
from [UPF](http://www.upf.edu/en/) University.
In the meantime I worked for a non-profit foundation called [Barcelona
Media](http://www.barcelonamedia.org/) (2012-2014) 
and for [Dolby](https://www.dolby.com/) Iberia (2014-now).

An updated CV can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-scaini/).


**Documents**:

-   My PhD's thesis **Wavelet-based spatial audio framework: from Ambisonics to Wavelets.
    A novel approach to spatial audio.** [arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03287).
-   My Master's thesis **Study of the associated production of a Z
    boson and hadronic jets in proton-proton collisions at the CMS
    experiment** ([on INFN official
    website](http://www.infn.it/thesis/thesis_dettaglio.php?tid=5970))
-   My Bachelor's thesis **Una tecnica di calibrazione con elettroni
    isolati per il calorimetro elettromagnetico di CMS**
    ([on INFN
    official
    website](http://www.infn.it/thesis/thesis_dettaglio.php?tid=2644))
    ([or download from
    here](http://scaini.org/site/file_download/12/tesi.pdf))


**Papers**:
My papers are listed
[on ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Davide_Scaini/publications) 
or [on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1R60o-UAAAAJ).
If you want a copy, just contact me.


**Patents**:
The best way to have an updated list of my patents is to do a search on Google Patents, 
[like this one](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=%22davide+scaini%22).


**Public Code**:

- ATM my public code is very limited (for several reasons). In [this
    repository](https://bitbucket.org/davrandom/misc_projects/src) I
    collect some files that I find useful (configuration files or
    nano-projects).
    This might not be useful for other people, but after few times I
    forgot/lost code around, I simply decided that it's better to
    publish it.
- During my period in BM I devloped
    [IDHOA](https://github.com/BarcelonaMedia-Audio/idhoa) which is a
    piece of code to generate Ambisonics decodings for periphonic or
    dome-like irregular layouts. We wrote a paper presented at 55th AES
    International Conference (August 2014). The code is GPL, so feel
    free to contribute.

    *update* I forked my own project since I left BM. The [updated code
    can be found here.](https://github.com/davrandom/idhoa) We presented
    another paper on IDHOA at the 138th AES Convention (May 2015) **\`An
    Evaluation of the IDHOA Ambisonics Decoder in Irregular Planar
    Layouts´**.

**Presentations**:

-   TBD


**Supervision of Bacher and Master thesis**:

Mostly in collaboration with Daniel Arteaga.
