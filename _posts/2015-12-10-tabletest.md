excerpt: A typical table in md

---

This is a typical table written in markdown

| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |

Which is cool and fast.

But actually I would like to make a table without borders... and for that you need to write the table in html :(
A [nice website](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables) can help in this task. Try it out!
