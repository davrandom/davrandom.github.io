In her keynote, the Executive Director of the GNOME Foundation, Karen Sandler, talks about her heart condition that is monitored by a pacemaker that is activated in emergencies. The executive notes that the pacemaker uses proprietary software that hasn't even been examined by the regulatory bodies. She demands access to the sources in order to check whether the device really works as promised by the manufacturer; she also asks questions that are already familiar from the desktop and server software area, such as what happens if the manufacturer goes out of business or a critical flaw is discovered in the device or its software. Sandler takes these and other aspects as an opportunity to present her ideas on a whole range of important open source software topics.
