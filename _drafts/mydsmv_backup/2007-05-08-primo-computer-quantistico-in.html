Notizia del 13 Febbraio:<br /><br />" VANCOUVER, B.C. or MT. VIEW, CA – February 13, 2007 – The world's first commercially viable quantum computer was unveiled and demonstrated today in Silicon Valley by D-Wave Systems, Inc., a privately-held Canadian firm headquartered near Vancouver. [...]"<br />dal sito dell'azienda produttrice <a href="http://www.dwavesys.com/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=4&cntnt01origid=15&amp;cntnt01returnid=21"> articolo D-Wave</a><br /><br />Un po' più miti le considerazioni del Cern Courier:<br />" The chip operates at a base temperature of 5 mK and contains 16 quantum bits, or qubits, arranged in a 4 × 4 array. Each one is coupled to its nearest neighbours, including diagonally, giving a total of 42 couplings.   <p> While quantum computing offers the potential to create value in areas where problems or requirements exceed the capability of digital computing, the demonstration by D-Wave was met with some scepticism by the scientific community, as the number of connections in the chip is very limited and further details from the company were scarce. Nevertheless, if further developments show a clear speed increase compared with conventional digital computers, this could be an important step towards quantum computing."<br />dal sito del Cern Courier<br /><a href="http://cerncourier.com/main/article/47/3/18">cern courier article</a><br /></p><br />Da un blog sicuramente più autorevole del nostro <a href="http://physicsandphysicists.blogspot.com/2007/03/update-on-that-quantum-computer.html"> physics and physicists</a> alcune notizie più recenti e considerazioni più illuminate...<br /><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>buona lettura<br />d
