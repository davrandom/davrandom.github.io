so... I was wandering about the possibility of having a telegram bot that interfaces with Jekyll to publish new posts...
these days when I go home I don't really want to open another PC and start writing posts...

apparently there is no such a thing as a telegram Jekyll bot yet, but an Android app should be already there, no? let's ask Google...

and tha-daaa I found [MrHyde](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.faudroids.mrhyde) by faudroids! and this is my very first test from their Android app

let's see what happens

update: it would be cool to drag and drop stuff like links and images and get the markdown already in place... dreaming?

update 2: I actually opened a bug in faudroid github and they were kind enough to add a markdown cheatshett to their app. Now waiting for this fix to propagate until google Play.

update 3: the fix reached Google play!
thanks!
