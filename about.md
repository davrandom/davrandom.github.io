![That's me!](images/18t.jpg)
picture by [Superben,](http://www.flickr.com/photos/superben155) thanks!

I'm **interested** in *open source, i.e. GNU/Linux, open hardware
(openmoko, arduino, ...), open mapping (openstreetmap), ... in music,
acoustics, photography, motorbikes, traveling around, DIY, ...*

I have a [M.Sc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree) in
[particle physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics) from
[University of Trieste (Italy).](http://df.units.it/?q=en)

Now I'm enrolled at [UPF](http://www.upf.edu/en/) for a
[Ph.D.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy) in
[Information and Communication
Technologies.](http://www.upf.edu/dtic/en/) In the meantime I worked for
a non-profit foundation called [Barcelona
Media.](http://www.barcelonamedia.org/) Now I moved to a bigger company,
still working on sound and maths.

**Documents**:

-   My Master's thesis **`Study of the associated production of a Z
    boson and hadronic jets in proton-proton collisions at the CMS
    experiment'** ([on INFN official
    website](http://www.infn.it/thesis/thesis_dettaglio.php?tid=5970))
-   My Bachelor's thesis **`Una tecnica di calibrazione con elettroni
    isolati per il calorimetro elettromagnetico di CMS'** ([on INFN
    official
    website](http://www.infn.it/thesis/thesis_dettaglio.php?tid=2644))
    ([or download from
    here](http://scaini.org/site/file_download/12/tesi.pdf))

**Papers**:
My papers are listed
[here](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Davide_Scaini/publications)
If you want a copy, just contact me somehow.

**Public Code**:

-   ATM my public code is very limited (for several reasons). In [this
    repository](https://bitbucket.org/davrandom/misc_projects/src) I
    collect some files that I find useful (configuration files or
    nano-projects).
    This might not be useful for other people, but after few times I
    forgot/lost code around, I simply decided that it's better to
    publish it.
-   During my period in BM I devloped
    [IDHOA](https://github.com/BarcelonaMedia-Audio/idhoa) which is a
    piece of code to generate Ambisonics decodings for periphonic or
    dome-like irregular layouts. We wrote a paper presented at 55th AES
    International Conference (August 2014). The code is GPL, so feel
    free to contribute.
    *update* I forked my own project since I left BM. The [updated code
    can be found here.](https://github.com/davrandom/idhoa) We presented
    another paper on IDHOA at the 138th AES Convention (May 2015) **\`An
    Evaluation of the IDHOA Ambisonics Decoder in Irregular Planar
    LayoutsÂ´**.

**Presentations**:

-   TBD
